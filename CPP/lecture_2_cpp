int main always returns an integer.
return 0 means success.
not really used too much

integer division does automatic truncation. you must create a double if you want to work with the decmial result

1. Enumeration

define type

enum directionT {North, South, East, West}
now you can use "directionT" as a type, like you would with "int"

2. Records
- structure type, here is what is in
- declare a new type

struct pointT {
  double x;
  double y;
};

can copy all of the items from a struct onto an object (i think)

3. parameter passing
- pass by value. it makes a copy. new space, new storage.
- pass by reference, use the "&" and the parameter that was used will be modified

c++
== will compare where or not the ascii letters are the same or not. it will not look at the address, like java would.

+= to concat, can only do it with characters and strings. do add in an integer, you woould have to do something else.

member function in c++, aka method in java

there is no rule for what will happen if you try to access an element of a string that is out of bounds. it could crash, it could return 0...

w/o a value, creating a string will initilize as an empty string
