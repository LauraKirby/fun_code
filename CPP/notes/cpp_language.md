Find more on [C++ programming language](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++.html).  Designer of the language is Bjarne Stroustrup. Bjarne lists a definition of C++ as:

"... a general purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

- is a better C
- supports data abstraction
- supports object oriented programming
- supports generic programming"

The language started in 1979 and was originally known as C with Classes. Essentially it meant that class files (used in object-oriented programming), were added to the C language. In 1983 it was renamed to C++.
