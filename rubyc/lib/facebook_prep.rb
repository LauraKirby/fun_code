# at worst quick sort is O(n^2) like insertion and bubble sort
# typically acts like an O(n log n)
# n because we have to do n-1 comparisions each time the method is called
# log n because we have to divide the list log n times
# if we always choose a bad pivot, the run time will be n, resulting in O(n^2)
  # decrease the chance of this happening by calculating a midpoint

# InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child;
# PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent;
