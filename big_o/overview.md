linear_search is O(n)

constant time O(1)

the algorithm completes in the same amount of time no matter what the size of the input is. An example of this is pushing or popping from a stack:


O(log(n))

This approach is commonly known as “divide and conquer”. Rather than looping through all items, divide-and-conquer algorithms halve the input size (often recursively) at each step.


O(nlog(n))
Some algorithms involve some kind of divide-and-conquer strategy combined with linear processing of all elements. This is very common in sorting algorithms. An example of this is merge_sort:

5: 
30 - 35:
