// arrow function
// An arrow function expression is an anonymous function expression 
// written with the “fat arrow” syntax ( => ). 
// Like traditional function expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted, 
// and so you cannot call them before you declare them. 
// They are also always anonymous—there is no way to name an arrow function.
